This is the program for the thesis entitled "Facial Recognition System by Using a Three Triangle Method Utilizing OpenCV and Dlib"

The basic approach for this Facial Recognition is it uses only 4 points of the Face namely the Left and Right Lateral Canthus, the Nasal Bridge and the Apex of the Nose. 
Creating 3 triangles around the face. Using basic trigonometry, the recognition of faces will then commence.
